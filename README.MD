**# BookVerse - Book Catalog & Review Platform (Cloud-Infrastructure Only)**

# **Background**

BookVerse is a fictious cloud-deployed application designed to showcase build, deploy and manage modern book catalog and review system using AWS infrastructure with KodeKloud's Playground (i.e a temporary 3 hour AWS environment with limited features available for hands-on learning)

# **Objectives**

- This infrastructure is laid out in a way that users can browse books, authors and submit reviews.
- Build to demonstrate core cloud architecture principles including use of managed services and Infrastructure as Code.
- Enable rapid provisioning and teardown of AWS resources using Terraform that are within the constraints of KodeKloud Playground time limit.
- Integrate key AWS services such as EC2, RDS, S3 and IAM with automated CI/CD workflows.


# **Why BookVerse?**

- BookVerse is a practical simulation of how cloud resources are modeled, provisioned, managed, and scaled behind the scenes. By focusing on repeatable, automated deployments, it highlights the importance of operational efficiency and security best practices in Cloud Infrastructure management.
